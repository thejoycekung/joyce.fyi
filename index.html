  <h1>Joyce Kung</h1>
  <h2>4A Computer Science, Minor in English Literature </h2>
  <p>I'm a 22-year-old student currently in my fourth year of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I like <a
      href="https://emojipedia.org/ok-hand-sign/">emoji</a>, <a
      href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all">podcasts</a>, watching TV, singing <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheAcaBellas">a cappella</a>, and <a
      href="https://www.bartleby.com/113/2089.html">poetry</a>.</p>
  <p>I believe in working at companies where people come first, where people are passionate about the product they
    build, and where people value personal growth.</p>
  <p>Currently, I'm looking for my final internship, hopefully centred around DevOps. Some of my previous internship
    experience includes: DevOps at <a href="https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/">Autodesk Maya</a> (Winter 2020) and
    Android @ <a href="https://www.scribd.com">Scribd</a> (Spring 2019) and <a
      href="https://www.choosemuse.com">Interaxon</a> (Fall
    2018). </p>
  <p>I'm currently looking for <strong>DevOps</strong> positions - although I've worked mostly as an Android engineer in
    the past, I think I've found a passion in helping other developers develop better. If you're interested in hearing
    my story, or you're
    hiring interns for Fall 2020 (September-December) or new graduates, feel free to reach out!</p>

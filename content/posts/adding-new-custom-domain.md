Last Saturday, among the flurry of excitement that was Down Under CTF, I bought the domain `joyce.fyi` on a whim.

Buying a domain was a big step for me! I've been using Github Pages since 2017, and I've always, always just used the `thejoycekung.github.io` URL. It's super long: it's a pain to type, and to dictate to another person. But it's free. And I'd never bought a domain before (even for a project). So I just kept using the default one.

Fast-forward to summer 2020: I had a new setup for my website. I was (/am) trying to blog again. I'm using my website more frequently. Address bar auto-fill is saving my ass but truly, linking to this site is getting way too long.

TL;DR: I read a lot of books this year. I put some on lists. Spoilers and swears ahead!

At the end of 2019, I vaguely thought about reading one book a week in 2020. It was going to be one of my "New Year's Resolutions",[^nyr] and I really felt like I missed reading for fun again.

[^nyr]: Shockingly this (New Year's Resolutions) is one of those things that's turned out really well for me. In 2019 I aimed to drink at most 4 bubble teas a month (this worked well for many months), and in 2020 I aimed to make it *explicitly* 1 bubble tea a week. I did not anticipate a global pandemic.

I used to be one of those kids that loved reading - would borrow 8-12 books at a time - would make my parents take me to the library every week - my parents would joke about book-borrowing limits - I ate 600-page novels for breakfast.[^skim]

[^skim]: This is also how I learned how to skim. Not the greatest habit, but a very, very useful one.

Then high school happened, and I slowly transitioned to not going to the library at all, and then only reading books for English class.[^english] Then university happened, and I wasn't really reading ... much of anything.[^docs]

[^english]: Don't get me wrong. I really liked some of the books we read in English class, like *The Wars* by Timothy Findley (the second-person POV is brilliantly done, and I still think about the way the elements are used, the mirroring between Robert and his mom, the barn fire ...) or *Death of a Salesman* by Arthur Miller. 

[^docs]: Uh, except assignments, and slides, and documentation I guess. But how much enjoyment did I really derive from any of that?

I took one of my favourite classes ever in university - ENGL 208N: Sex in Literature - in the fall of 2019, and after reading a bunch of raunchy shit for class, I decided I wanted to try reading, a lot, again, for real.

# Criteria and Selection

Previously read books did *not* count. Books of poetry, or plays (yes, I read a play this year) did.

I originally used the Toronto Public Library's 2020 reading challenge as a guide for selection since they had interesting themes, but this quickly devolved - the challenge (and its extended version) really only accommodated ~24 books. Which was not even half of my goal.

At the beginning of the year, I was mostly putting holds on books and waiting for them to be physically available for pickup. Thankfully I started transitioning away from that in February, and I mostly used the Libby app (available on Android and Windows 10, aka both my devices) for the rest of the year.[^hold]

[^hold]: But also I had a book - *Trickster Drift* - sitting in my house between March and June while the libraries were closed. Like, literally closed. They taped the little slot shut where you can put books in for returns.

Using the Libby app meant I had a lot more access to what *everyone else* was reading, *and* I could check which titles were actually available.

So my selection was pretty much, "what's popular and sounds interesting?".

Unfortunately, to my surprise, not everything that is popular is stuff that I enjoy. So I decided to curate some lists out of the books that I read, if just to reflect on the year itself.

And of course these lists are in absolutely no order whatsoever.

# Least Favourite Books of 2020
Some of these could also belong to the Most "WTF" category. But there's ... an *art* to being "WTF", but good, in my mind. These books all made me ~~in~~explicably angry in some way, but not a good way.

- Convenience Store Woman
  - Why. WHY does she end up with the guy who is weird and demeaning! Why!
  - I couldn't help but feel pity for the narrator[^cvw] the whole time.
- The Dinner by Herman Koch
  - I thought the thing about their two boys was going to be that they're gay.
  - I would've preferred that so much more.
  - No, apparently they're *racist* and ***violent** and so is the dad*.
  - Everything is bad.
- The Immortalists
  - [the cabbage tweet]
  - Honestly, even given that section, I was so utterly upset that they killed off Simon *with AIDS* that I almost gave up reading. He was so fucking *happy*!!!
  - I'm also upset that [the magician girl] also died. I was really hoping that there *was* going to be some kind of magic in here - that maybe Simon wasn't dead - that maybe she was going to be okay too.
  - Everything kind of went meh from there.
  - Simon deserved better.

[^cvw]: I possibly mean the main character here. I forget what POV this was written in.

# Most "WTF did I just read" Books of 2020
This is not to say that the book was *bad* by *any* means. Just that I was ... not, uh, sufficiently prepared to read it. At all.

- The Secret History by Donna Tarte
- Quichotte
- Dorian Gray
- Son of a Trickster and Trickster Drift
- Alice Isn't Dead
- Catch-22
- Everything I Never Told You by Celeste Ng
  - I was **screaming** at the end of every chapter. I read this after reading *Little Fires Everywhere*, but after reading this I know for sure: Celeste Ng fucking *knows* what "keeping secrets in a family" means. I almost feel bad for her kids. Their mom *knows*.
  - By far the worst part was the subtle race microaggressions with James and the whole teacher-student dynamic (*multiple times*).

# "I mean it was, like Ok I guess"
You ever read a book and it just kind of washes over you? Like yeah, that happened, but I don't really ... have many strong feelings about it? 

- Everything All at Once by Bill Nye
- How to Talk about Books You Haven't Read
- Fight Club
- Joy Luck Club
- Cold Comfort Farm
- Less

# "This got a little too topical"

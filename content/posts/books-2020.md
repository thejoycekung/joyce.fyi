TL;DR: I read a lot of books this year. I put some on lists. I will not justify these lists.[^justify]

[^justify]: Okay, this is a lie. I might justify some of these. In footnotes. 

At the end of 2019, I vaguely thought about reading one book a week in 2020. It was going to be one of my "New Year's Resolutions",[^nyr] and I really felt like I missed reading for fun again.[^docs]

[^nyr]: Shockingly this (New Year's Resolutions) is one of those things that's turned out really well for me. In 2019 I aimed to drink at most 4 bubble teas a month (this worked well for many months), and in 2020 I aimed to make it *explicitly* 1 bubble tea a week. I did not anticipate a global pandemic, which made it *far* too easy to hit my goal.

[^docs]: Assignments, slides, and documentation are *not* fun.

That term - fall 2019 - I had taken one of my favourite classes ever in university - ENGL 208N: Sex in Literature, and after reading a bunch of raunchy shit for class - after finding reading fun again! despite reading for assignments - I decided I wanted to try reading, a lot, again, for real.

# Criteria and Selection

Previously read books did *not* count.[^prev] Plays, essay collections, full-length poetry collections, and graphic novels did.

[^prev]: Not that I reread anything this year anyway.

I originally used the [Toronto Public Library's 2020 reading challenge](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/content/reading-challenge/pdfs/reading-challenge-2020.pdf) as a guide for selection since they had interesting categories, but this quickly devolved - the challenge (and its extended version) really only accommodated ~24 books. Which was not even half of my goal.

At the beginning of the year, I was mostly putting holds on books and waiting for them to be physically available for pickup. Thankfully I started transitioning away from that in February, and I mostly used the Libby app (available on Android and Windows 10, aka both my devices) for the rest of the year.

Using the Libby app meant I had a lot more access to what *everyone else* was reading, *and* I could check which titles were actually available.

So my selection was pretty much, "what's popular and sounds interesting?".

Unfortunately, to my surprise, not everything that is popular is stuff that I enjoy. So I decided to curate some lists out of the books that I read, if just to reflect on the year itself.

And of course these lists are in absolutely no order whatsoever.

# The Worst Ones
These books all made me ~~in~~explicably angry in some way, but not a good way.

- *Convenience Store Woman* by Sayaka Murata
- *The Dinner* by Herman Koch
- *The Immortalists* by Chloe Benjamin[^tweet]

[^tweet]: Not only did I have to read [this passage](https://twitter.com/commitsbyjoyce/status/1316572560335736833), I had to read about how that character died of AIDS a few chapters later.

# Most "WTF did I just read"
This is not to say that the book was *bad* by *any* means. Just that I was ... not, uh, sufficiently prepared to read it. At all.

- *The Secret History* by Donna Tartt[^tsh]
- *Quichotte* by Salman Rushdie
- *The Picture of Dorian Grey* by Oscar Wilde[^dorian]
- *Son of a Trickster* by Eden Robinson[^trickster]
- *Trickster Drift* by Eden Robinson[^covid]
- *Alice Isn't Dead* by Joseph Fink
- *Catch-22* by Joseph Heller
- *Everything I Never Told You* by Celeste Ng
- *Bestiary* by K-Ming Chang[^bestiary]

[^tsh]: When I first saw this book, I was like, "Oh interesting! Just a bunch of college kids who like classics. Alright!" And then, they introduced *murder*! What the hell!

[^dorian]: In a similar vein to *The Secret History*, no one warned me about murder.

[^trickster]: This has now been adapted into a TV show, *Trickster*, whose news originally sparked my interest due to being an Indigenous-led production with an Indigenous cast as well. However, recently the show's director, Michelle Latimer, has been shown to have [questionable (if not non-existent) ties](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/michelle-latimer-kitigan-zibi-indigenous-identity-1.5845310) to her claimed Indigenous communities. [Latimer will no longer be working on the show in Season 2](https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/michelle-latimer-resigns-trickster-1.5850408).

[^covid]: This is the book that sat on our living room table from March to June. My sister, ever a minimalist, *hated* the fact that it would stay in our living room with no foreseeable return date. I remember trying to return it - thinking maybe - and discovering that the return slots at the library were taped shut. Since borrowing this book, I have only stepped into a library once this year, to borrow a physical book whose hold line was much, much shorter than the ebook hold line.

[^bestiary]: There are several creative depictions of blowjobs in this book. I'm not saying that to deter you. Just to inform.

# "I mean it was, like, Ok I guess"
You ever read a book and it just kind of washes over you? Like yeah, that happened, but I don't really ... have many strong feelings about it? 

- *Everything All At Once: How to Unleash Your Inner Nerd, Tap Into Radical Curiosity, and Solve Any Problem* by Bill Nye[^bill]
- *How to Talk about Books You Haven't Read* by Pierre Bayard[^pierre]
- *Fight Club* by Chuck Palahniuk
- *The Joy Luck Club* by Amy Tan
- *Cold Comfort Farm* by Stella Gibbons
- *Less* by Andrew Sean Greer
- *The New Queer Conscience* by Adam Eli[^queer]

[^bill]: I want to pay someone to tell Bill Nye or his ghostwriter or whomever that using *they* pronouns is okay. Reading "he or she" every other page got very tiring, very quickly.

[^pierre]: Ironically this is the only book I read as an audiobook. That made it extra hard to remember. The only thing I remember is that there are 4 kinds of book <> you relationship. I do not remember the actual kinds themselves.

[^queer]: Allies! Don't belong in the LGBTQ+ acronym. They really don't! To explicitly name Ally in your LGBTQIAA+ acronym ... But relegate others to the plus ... These are choices that I do not agree with.

# "This got a little too topical"
*gestures vaguely at everything* Just, you know.

- *The Crucible* by Arthur Miller[^crucible]
- *The Water Dancer* by Ta-Nehisi Coates
- *This Changes Everything* by Naomi Klein
- *The Testaments* by Margaret Atwood[^atwood]
- *Kill All Normies: Online Culture Wars from 4chan and Tumblr to Trump and the Alt-Right* by Angela Nagle[^normies]
- *Brave New World* by Aldous Huxley
- *Too Smart: How Digital Capitalism is Extracting Data, Controlling Our Lives, and Taking Over the World* by Jathan Sadowski

[^crucible]: I am feeling like I want to go back and reread/consider how I feel about Abigail.

[^atwood]: This is not a statement on the book itself, but rather what happened around reading it: I got the notification that I got a skip-the-line copy (essentially, I had a chance to *not* wait another 12 weeks to borrow the book for 3 weeks; I could borrow the book _now_ for 1 week) shortly before taking the subway/bus to Waterloo for 2 hours and proceeded to spend my entire bus ride reading it and finished it as the bus rolled into campus. I wish I'd known that would be my last time going to Waterloo for the foreseeable future. I would've said goodbye a little better.

[^normies]: I read this book after a coworker (a fellow intern, but really a PhD student) mentioned it with the idea that the left alienates men because it focuses on spaces for, well, not them (this is a very, very poor paraphrasing. I wish I could've seen this coworker more.). I don't remember reading that in the book, but I remember finding the book real interesting.

# My Favourite Books of 2020
I was going to add footnotes for these too but then I realised that every entry in this list needs a footnote.

- *Do Not Say We Have Nothing* by Madeleine Thien
  - It is December 31, 2020 as I write this, a year from when I technically started this book, and I still think about it.
  - I am going to reread this book today.
  - I am so, so excited to see it again.
- *Pachinko* by Min Jin Lee
  - This book made me cry in several different ways at many different times.
  - I learned a lot about the intersection of Korea and Japan and the messy implications it has for peoples.
- *This Place: 150 Years Retold* by Kateri Akiwenzie-Damm, Chelsea Vowel, Katherena Vermette, Jen Storm, Niigaanwewidam James Sinclair, David Alexander Robertson, Richard Van Camp, Brandon Mitchell, Sonny Assu, Rachel Qitsualik-Tinsley, Sean Qitsualik-Tinsley
  - This book felt a bit like something you would read as a child in social studies - with discussion questions at the end of each short story and all - but each story is poignant in its own way, and together they make something beautiful.
    - Perhaps what I really mean here is, *this book felt a bit like something I would have wanted to read as a child in social studies*.
  - My favourite one is the last one (I will not spoil why, or what it is about).
- *Gender Queer: A Memoir* by Maia Kobabe
  - I first saw Maia Kobabe's work in the San Francisco [Cartoon Art Museum](https://www.cartoonart.org) when my friends and I stumbled in after exploring the piers. 
  - It was [an exhibit about, well, this book actually](https://www.cartoonart.org/maia-kobabe-gender-queer), and the way e talked about gender was so interesting I apparently remembered it some N months after seeing that single wall of art.
    - *A Fire Story*, which was also an exhibit at the time as a side note, was *also* incredibly interesting now that I'm writing this and I should go find that author's work as well.
  - I remember being so consumed I finished this book on the subway home (I am not normally a subway reader), and as soon as I got out of the tunnels I texted at least 3 people, "you have to read this".
- *This Changes Everything* by Naomi Klein
  - After a summer of trying to consider my place in society, it was this book that really said, "hey. actually, everything that's going wrong [especially with the environment and our planet] - that's just capitalism. all of it. no, throwing money at tech won't work. giving power to people who actually know how to take care of our planet is what will."
  - It changed a lot, for me.
- *Everything Is Beautiful, and I'm Not Afraid* by Yao Xiao
  - As a person who is semi-frequently Sad™ (I say semi-frequently because it is much simpler to perform tasks than consider my emotional well-being, and every time I consider my emotional state I -) and a member of the Chinese diaspora (and having not come out to my parents yet), Xiao's small comics were relatable and lovable and perceptive and hopeful all rolled into one.
  - I bought this book for a friend shortly after finishing it. Maybe we can all be a little less lonely, knowing that everything is beautiful, and we shouldn't be afraid.
- *Too Smart: How Digital Capitalism is Extracting Data, Controlling Our Lives, and Taking Over the World* by Jathan Sadowski
  - As a person who has worked in, was working for most of this year, and will go on to work in tech, considering the tech industry and its societal impacts has weighed a lot on me this year. 
  - This book did an excellent job of taking thoughts and observations that I already had and was trying to understand and organize, and put them into themes and showed me even *more* of how tech has permeated our society.

52. (*) *Bestiary* by K-Ming Chang

[^ahem]: This is my small confession space. If you read carefully, I started reading *Do Not Say We Have Nothing* on December 31, 2019, AKA I did not fully read this book in 2020, AKA I probably cheated. There are several things that went wrong (that I did wrong?) that culminated in me having to read 2 books in one week (as opposed to one) (*The New Queer Conscience* and *Everything Is Beautiful, and I'm Not Afraid*) and me needing to finish *Bestiary* in the span of three days: namely, I did not start reading things until January 6th, the first Monday of the year, and I counted my weeks starting Monday - Sunday. (There is of course, no "have to" or "need" to do any of this. I could have just easily said, "haha, fuck it.") I do not actually know if I hit the "actual" goal of reading a book a week in 2020. There are 52 weeks in a year apparently. 2020 felt like many more.

# To 2021

To be honest, my 2021 book goals are incredibly nebulous at the moment. Can I stop reading white men? I would love to read more Indigenous authors. More diasporic Chinese authors. More poetry - more of my friends' poetry. Dare I say it - more non-fiction? (I read 2 good non-fiction books and I think I'm prepared to read more, hah.)

A part of me wants to return to my old ways of annotating books as I read (borrowed, DRM e-books make this hard), but I am reluctant to *own* books until I have a space where I feel is home. (The physicality of book ownership feels like a large responsibility.)

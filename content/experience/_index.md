I'm interested in working in site reliability engineering, platform, and infrastructure teams. I love helping other developers develop better.

This coming fall, I'll be working as a Software Engineering Intern at [BofA Securities (formerly Bank of America Merrill Lynch)](https://www.bofaml.com/content/boaml/en_us/home.html) in Toronto.  
Some of my previous internship experiences include: DevOps @ [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/) (Winter 2020) and Android Platform @ [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) (Spring 2019). You can see [my full resume here](/Resume.pdf).

If you're interested in hearing my story, or you're hiring new graduates for 2021, feel free to reach out to thejoycekung [at] gmail.

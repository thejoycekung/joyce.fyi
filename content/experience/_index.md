I'm interested in working in site reliability engineering, platform, and infrastructure teams. I love helping other developers develop better.

I'm currently a CI Signal Shadow for the [Kubernetes 1.20](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.20) Release Team, as well as a copyeditor for the [Bit Project](https://www.bitproject.org/).

Some of my previous internship experiences include: DevOps @ [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/) (Winter 2020) and Android Platform @ [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) (Spring 2019). You can see [my full resume here](/Resume.pdf).

If you're interested in hearing my story, or you're hiring new graduates for 2021, feel free to reach out to thejoycekung [at] gmail.

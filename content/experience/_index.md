I'm interested in working in site reliability engineering, platform, and infrastructure teams. I also have a strong interest in [security](/categories/writeup). I love creating an environment where other developers can develop better, and I think these two fields help me do that best.

I'm currently the CI Signal lead for the [Kubernetes 1.21](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/releases/release-1.21) Release Team. Previously, I was a marketing writer for the [Bit Project](https://www.bitproject.org/).

Some of my previous internship experiences include: DevOps @ [Autodesk Maya](https://www.autodesk.com/products/maya/) (Winter 2020) and Android Platform @ [Scribd](https://www.scribd.com) (Spring 2019). You can see [my full resume here](/Resume.pdf).

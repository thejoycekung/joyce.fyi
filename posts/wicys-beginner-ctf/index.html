If you have a question or comment about this write-up, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter <a href=https://twitter.com/commitsbyjoyce>@commitsbyjoyce</a>.</p><h1 id=w01>W01</h1><p>This challenge took us to <a href=https://stoic-brattain-6dcbf9.netlify.app/w01/>a website &ldquo;LingoFlow&rdquo;</a> for learning languages, that contained a flag somewhere. The description hinted at using the Developer Tools to find the flag.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w01.jpg alt="Screenshot of LingoFlow: features Spanish, German, Dutch flags in upper right; left hand side has a picture of a mountain at night with a shooting star in the sky; right hand side has a quiz interface that says &ldquo;What is this translated to English?&rdquo; with the options &ldquo;Iceberg&rdquo;, &ldquo;Mountain&rdquo;, &ldquo;Field&rdquo;"></p><p>Things I tried:</p><ul><li>Looking in the source code (by pressing Ctrl+Shift+I) for flags<br>↪ Unfortunately the only ones available were country ones, though</li><li>Submitting the correct answer to the quiz<br>↪ Only reloaded the page</li></ul><p>This took me a really long time to solve (despite being &ldquo;easy&rdquo;!), but eventually I was given the tip (h/t Ruju) to look inside the dev console.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wicys-beginner-ctf/wicys-beginner-ctf/w01-flag.jpg alt="Screenshot of console for LingoFlow"></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Chrome Dev Console<br><strong>Flag</strong>: Consolel0ggr3</p><h1 id=a01>A01</h1><p>This challenge consisted of a zip file, which when unzipped, gave a photo of a white man with Morse code in the top-left corner.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wicys-beginner-ctf/a01.jpg alt="Photo of white man with Morse code in the top-left"></p><p>Using a <a href=https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html>Morse code converter</a>, we get the following result:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wicys-beginner-ctf/a01-flag.jpg alt="Screenshot of Morse code input and flag"></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href=https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html>Morse code converter</a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: MORCEFORCE#<br><strong>Further reading</strong>: Google offers a Morse code keyboard and <a href=https://morse.withgoogle.com/learn/>learning site</a> that are quite fun and easy to move through!</p><h1 id=fe01>FE01</h1><p>This challenge consisted of a zip file, which when unzipped, gave a Rich Text Format entitled <code>document.rtf</code>.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/fe01.jpg alt="Screenshot of document.rtf in Microsoft Word that says &ldquo;No flags here Look elsewhere&rdquo; in ASCII art"></p><p>I struggled with this one a lot too - until I was tipped that I can change the text colour (lol - thank you again, Ruju). Doing so reveals the flag at the bottom of the document.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/fe01-flag.jpg alt="Screenshot of flag text in Microsoft Word"></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Microsoft Word<br><strong>Flag</strong>: 𝑛𝑖𝐶𝑒𝐴𝑛𝐷𝐸𝑎𝑠𝑦10018</p><h1 id=w03>W03</h1><p>This challenge took us to <a href=https://stoic-brattain-6dcbf9.netlify.app/w03/>a website &ldquo;Expense Factory&rdquo;</a> which appears to allow users to upload receipts for workplace expenses. The description hinted that we would need to fix something on the site in order to reveal the flag.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w03.jpg alt="Screenshot of Expense Factory showing Expense Report #1337 with three items, each with an &ldquo;Upload Receipt&rdquo; button on the right hand side"></p><p>My first instinct is to just scroll through the page. At the footer, I spot the following:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w03-error.jpg alt="Screenshot of Expense Factory footer, featuring a broken image with descriptor &ldquo;PNG of the copyright logo&rdquo;"></p><p>Examining the source code more closely, it&rsquo;s clear that someone left off the <code>png</code> extension when linking to the copyright logo - and that logo is exactly what we need:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w03-code.jpg alt="Screenshot of Expense Factory code, with an image source &ldquo;assets/images/flag." "></p><p>Adjusting the linked asset to be <code>assets/images/flag.png</code> reveals the image:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w03-flag.png alt="Meme titled &ldquo;The flag is&rdquo; of someone slamming a blue button labelled with the flag"></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Chrome Dev Tools<br><strong>Flag</strong>: FIXINGBROKENL1NKS</p><h1 id=c01>C01</h1><p><del>Unfortunately the challenge description was essential here: it contained the ciphertext needed to obtain the flag. The description also hinted that the method used here is related to a famous Roman.</del></p><p><del>The famous Roman really gives it away here, but the ciphertext is encoded using a Caesar cipher; in particular, ROT13. Using any Caesar cipher decoder will reveal the flag.</del></p><p><em>Edit</em>: Thanks to Catherine C., I now have a screencap of the original challenge!</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/c01.png alt="Screenshot: C01 100 pts. Below: We have been provided this text. Apparently it uses some historic and classic cipher used by the romans! Followed by ciphertext."></p><p>The ciphertext is: A zsnw s dgl gx aflwjwklafy klgjawk lg lwdd stgml lzak ogfvwjxmd sfv zaklgjau uahzwj. A oadd zgownwj ksnw lzsl xgj sfglzwj laew. A cfgo qgm sjw egkl aflwjklwv af lzw xdsy. Lzw xdsy ak ZaklgjqSfvUjqhlgXLO.</p><p>Fortunately, thanks to the hint, we know that we should be using a Caesar cipher (or shift cipher). Using a shift of 8, we get the following:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/c01-flag.jpg alt="Screenshot of ciphertext and decoded text side-by-side"></p><p>Which gives us the flag easily.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=ROT13(true,true,8)">Caesar cipher decoder</a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: HistoryAndCryptoFTW<br><strong>Further reading</strong>: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher>Caesar ciphers</a> don&rsquo;t <em>just</em> refer to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13>ROT13</a> - in fact, it&rsquo;s any &ldquo;shift&rdquo; cipher. Also, ROT13 is its own inverse (since the alphabet is 26 letters long).</p><h1 id=ce01>CE01</h1><p>This challenge was another zip file, which contained a single file <code>flag.txt</code>. Opening this file in Notepad shows a bunch of numbers:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/ce01.jpg alt="Screenshot of flag.txt and a lot of numbers"></p><p>Notice how each number is never more than 3 digits long, and each number never uses the digit 9. This format reminds me a lot of hexadecimal formats, but because the number 9 (or letters A-F) are never used, it has to be a lower base. Another common base is octal (base 8), although I wasn&rsquo;t aware it&rsquo;s used for text encoding.</p><p>Using an <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Octal('Space')">octal to text converter</a>, I get the following result:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/ce01-flag.jpg alt="Screenshot of converted text from octal numbers"></p><p>Sweeeeeeeeeeet.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Octal('Space')">Octal to Text converter</a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: eightByEIgHT9100012</p><h1 id=fe02>FE02</h1><p>Yet another zip file challenge! This zip contained a PDF file entitled <code>document.pdf</code>, while the challenge description noted that the PDF&rsquo;s layers were still intact.</p><p>Opening the file in Adobe Acrobat Reader, we see immediately that some of the words/phrases in the PDF have been redacted - including the <strong>Flag</strong>:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/fe02.jpg alt="Screenshot of document.pdf"></p><p>Given the hint, the first thing I try to do is try and &ldquo;hide&rdquo; the top layer of redacted marks. However, opening the layers panel in Adobe shows me there are no layers.</p><p>However, playing with the PDF a bit more, I realise you can still select the &ldquo;redacted&rdquo; text. Here, I&rsquo;ve copied it to my clipboard and added it as a note to make it more visible:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/fe02-flag.jpg alt="Screenshot of document flag as note"></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Adobe Acrobat Reader (really, any PDF tool)<br><strong>Flag</strong>: n1CeReDaCTION-sureLYNot911081</p><h1 id=l01>L01</h1><p>More zip files! This challenge zip contained an access log <code>access.log</code> to a webserver, and the description told us to look at the &ldquo;200&rdquo; HTTP responses to find the flag.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/l01.jpg alt="Terminal screenshot of access log"></p><p>Knowing this, I&rsquo;m going to use <code>grep</code>, a tool which <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep>&ldquo;prints lines matching a pattern&rdquo;</a> and <code>less</code>, a tool which allows you to <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/less>view and navigate text files</a>.</p><p>By running <code>grep "200" access.log | less</code>, we can view our search for &ldquo;200&rdquo; easily navigate through the results using <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> as down/up arrows respectively. This is still a lot of content, but moving down we find:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/l01-flag.jpg alt="Terminal screenshot of filtered access log"></p><p>Looking back, using <code>grep "f.l.a.g" access.log | less</code> would have been much more efficient, since we can use regular expressions to our advantage. However, it wasn&rsquo;t clear before <code>grep</code>-ing that the flag would be masked!</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/grep><code>grep</code></a>, <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/less><code>less</code></a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: Ma3terLogPars3r<br><strong>Further reading</strong>: The logs mention <a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=cve-2014-6271">CVE-2014-6271</a> several times, and many of the 404 results are directed towards <code>0LX9YJ4M</code> with a variety of extensions. As of yet, unsure as to <code>0LX9YJ4M</code>&rsquo;s significance.<br>If you&rsquo;re curious about regular expressions, <a href=https://regexr.com/>Regexr</a> and <a href=https://regex101.com/>Regex101</a> are excellent tools for creating regular expressions and offer references/cheat sheets.</p><h1 id=f03>F03</h1><p>Yet another zip file challenge. This zip file contained a corrupted PNG file, entitled <code>Amazing-PNG.png</code>. Our instructions were to find and fix the image to gain access to the file.</p><p>I did not, in fact, fix the file. Actually, what I did was use <code>xxd</code> to create a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump>hexdump</a> of the PNG file, and again use <code>less</code> to navigate the content.</p><p>By running <code>xxd Amazing-PNG.png | less</code>, we can see on the left a &ldquo;line&rdquo; number, the bytes in hexadecimal format, and an ASCII text translation of the bytes on the right:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/f03.jpg alt="Terminal screenshot of hexdump of Amazing-PNG.png"></p><p>Again scrolling through, we eventually find the flag. You&rsquo;ll notice that it&rsquo;s much more obvious than the log, because most of the hexdump is sparse garbage, so it doesn&rsquo;t translate well to ASCII characters.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/f03-flag.jpg alt="Terminal screenshot of flag"></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/xxd><code>xxd</code></a>, <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/less><code>less</code></a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: PNGHaxor1337</p><h1 id=fm02>FM02</h1><p>More. Zips. This challenge zip gave a program simply entitled <code>file</code> with a corrupted header, and we were told to fix it in order to get the flag.<br>This one could honestly be its own writeup (similar to <a href=#WH03>WH03</a>) because I spent SO LONG trying to understand it.</p><p>Using <code>xxd</code> was pointless, but some other things I also tried doing were:</p><ul><li>Running <code>file file</code> to see what kind of file it was (&ldquo;data&rdquo;)</li><li>Running <code>readelf -h file</code> to see whether it&rsquo;s an ELF file</li></ul><p><code>readelf</code> is used to display information about ELF files (and the flag <code>-h</code> displays the header in particular), and it told me: <code>Not an ELF file - it has the wrong magic bytes at the start</code>.</p><p>Well, that&rsquo;s a start. Wikipedia offers a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures>list of the magic bytes</a> for different file types; for ELF files, that&rsquo;s <code>7F 45 4C 46</code>.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s where things get messier. I tried:</p><ul><li>Overwriting the first 4 bytes using <code>hexedit</code></li><li>Inserting a new row of bytes (which is apparently not possible using <code>hexedit</code>?

Fortunately, over in Slack, Saba pointed out that the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format>Wikipedia page for ELF files</a> offers an excellent example of a ELF header, which helped guide me to how I should edit this file.</p><p>Here I experimented with:</p><ul><li>Overwriting the first two lines with the given header</li><li>Inserting the given header</li></ul><p>Both of which didn&rsquo;t work. However, Jodi pointed out that inserting <em>one</em> line of the header instead might be more beneficial to my cause.</p><p>Running this new file then outputted the flag immediately.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/file><code>file</code></a>, <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/hexedit><code>hexedit</code></a>, <a href=https://hexed.it>hexed.it</a> (web), <a href=https://linux.die.net/man/1/readelf><code>readelf</code></a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: headersAreImportANT91-91<br><strong>Further reading</strong>: <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(programming)#In_files>Magic bytes</a>, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executable_and_Linkable_Format>ELF files</a></p><h1 id=w02>W02</h1><p>This challenge led us to <a href=https://stoic-brattain-6dcbf9.netlify.app/w02/>a website &ldquo;Firemail&rdquo;</a>, which featured a login screen with the subtitle &ldquo;Secure Webmail BETA&rdquo;. The description told us that the flag would be found within the source code.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w02.jpg alt="Screenshot of website &ldquo;Firemail&rdquo;, under a blue paper plane on fire logo says &ldquo;Firemail&rdquo; with subtitle &ldquo;Secure Webmail BETA&rdquo;. Below is a login form titled &ldquo;Webmail login&rdquo; with three fields: username, password, and upload certificate, which is a file upload field"></p><p>My first thought with login screens is always SQL injection. So I play around with the login screen and try to submit some stuff - obviously I don&rsquo;t have any certificate to submit, but when I submit garbage, nothing happens either (and the password is exposed, in broad daylight):</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w02-url.jpg alt="Screenshot of URL bar: https://stoic-brattain-6dcbf9.netlify.app/w02/?username=felolf&password=egfjawie&certificate="></p><p>In fact, one of the big markers of a vulnerable database is an error popping up that the query is incorrect - and as I submit an empty form, I realise SQL injection is probably not the goal here.</p><p>Then I go digging through the source. Turns out their form needs a proper error page:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/w02-code.jpg alt="Screenshot of form element in source code; a TODO reads, &ldquo;Show error message here if they don&rsquo;t enter correct details. Perhaps redirect to error-page.html&rdquo;."></p><p>Navigating to <code>error-page.html</code> on this site then reveals the flag.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Chrome Dev Tools<br><strong>Flag</strong>: W3bD3buggerLevel1337<br><strong>Further reading</strong>: <a href=https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection>SQL injections, and how to do them</a> (although not relevant for this challenge)</p><h1 id=we01>WE01</h1><p>This challenge led us to a website simply titled, &ldquo;Nothing to see here&mldr;&rdquo; with a GIF of Spongebob furiously fanning flames with his own breath. The description told us that there was a hidden directory where we could then find the flag.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/we01.jpg alt="Screenshot of website; title &ldquo;Nothing to see here&rdquo; with Spongebob blowing out fire GIF"></p><p>Looking in the source code, it&rsquo;s pretty barebones. The only hint I&rsquo;ve got is that the Spongebob GIF belongs in an <code>img/wicys-beginner-ctf/</code> directory. Navigating to the <code>img/wicys-beginner-ctf/</code> directory, though, we&rsquo;re denied access.</p><p>This is where I start just trying random directories and hoping for something to stick (it doesn&rsquo;t). At this point, I get a tip from Ruju to use a tool called <a href=https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/discover-hidden-directories-and-files>URL Fuzzer</a>.</p><p>URL Fuzzer allows you to discover hidden directories and files given a domain, which is exactly what we need. Running URL Fuzzer on this website gives us:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/we01-dir.jpg alt="Screenshot of URL Fuzzer results; there are only two entries &ldquo;index&rdquo; and &ldquo;security&rdquo;"></p><p>Bingo. Navigating to the <code>security</code> directory, we get one entry: <code>flag.txt</code>, which is exactly what we need.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href=https://pentest-tools.com/website-vulnerability-scanning/discover-hidden-directories-and-files>URL Fuzzer</a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: verySecUReDireCToRY_1180018<br><strong>Further reading</strong>: <a href=https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing>On fuzzing, as a testing technique in general</a></p><h1 id=be01>BE01</h1><p>This challenge brought us back to the zip file. The file contained is a file simply called <code>program</code>; although <code>file program</code> and <code>readelf</code> both declared it to be an ELF file, I had problem running it on my machine.</p><p>Fortunately, my old friend <code>xxd</code> was back. Running <code>xxd program | less</code>, like we did with other files before, easily showed the flag with a bit of scrolling:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/be01.jpg alt="Terminal screenshot featuring ASCII text with flag, followed by &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do anything really &mldr;&mldr; I swear I&rsquo;m not hiding anything.

The description told us that there was a flag hidden in the source code, though - so time to go digging through.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/we02.jpg alt="Screenshot of website; title says &ldquo;Well hello there&mldr;&rdquo; with text &ldquo;Bet you can&rsquo;t view my source&rdquo;"></p><p>Inside the source, there are four Javascript files linked. As a person who does not speak Javascript, this is not a good sign.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/we02-code.jpg alt="Screenshot of four available Javascript files"></p><p>The first two, <code>webpack....js</code> and <code>app....js</code> look like default minified Javascript files.</p><p>The third, <code>framework....js</code> is incredibly long and contains two interesting variables, <code>SECRET_DO_NOT_PASS_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED</code> and <code>__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED</code>. To try and understand the file a bit more, I used <a href=https://unminify.com/>unminify</a> to make it a bit more readable. I spent a long time in this section, trying to make sense of what, actually, was the internal secret.</p><p>The last, <code>component....js</code> simply hinted, &ldquo;Well I guess the inspector works. I wonder what else is around here.&rdquo;</p><p>So dead ends, all around. Looking back on the homepage, I realise I missed something - just before the four Javascript files is a &ldquo;gatsby-chunk-mapping&rdquo; script, which has an array that contains the <code>component....js</code> link and two other similar ones, for <code>else</code> and <code>index</code>.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/we02-comp.jpg alt="Screenshot of available components"></p><p><code>else</code> sounds pretty darn suspicious, so navigating to that component URL shows the flag immediately.</p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Chrome Dev Tools, <a href=https://unminify.com/>unminify</a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: webPACkEd-AlRiGHT_7182</p><h1 id=wh03>WH03</h1><p>This challenge leads to <a href=https://ggcs-wh03.allyourbases.co/>a website simply with a blank screen</a>. The description is, really, equally unhelpful.<br>This, similar to FM02, could honestly be its own writeup. The resulting way I solved it is almost hilarious for how long I stared at this stupid blank screen.</p><p>I realized after trying to click random things and trying to type random things, the best way to interact with this is with arrow keys. (Obviously I tried the Konami arrow sequence, but that didn&rsquo;t go well.)</p><p>Sometimes after pressing a key, an arrow will show up:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wh03-arrow.jpg alt="Screenshot of black triangle pointing up"></p><p>Other things that can happen when an arrow key is pressed are:</p><ul><li>A change in background colour</li><li>Alerts, saying &ldquo;Nah&rdquo;, &ldquo;So close&rdquo;, &ldquo;Maybe next time&rdquo; and other similar taunts</li><li>A Soundcloud embed of <a href=https://soundcloud.com/stupid-gynjir/never-gonna-give-you-ruff>&ldquo;Never Gonna Give You Ruff&rdquo;</a></li><li>A redirect to a Google search of &ldquo;how to javascript&rdquo;</li></ul><p>Digging in the source reveals a big long line of minified Javascript, with a line that says &ldquo;The javascript below IS part of the challenge&rdquo;.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wh03-array.jpg alt="Screenshot of big Javascript, with note as above"></p><p>Obviously the first step, as before, is simply to unminify the Javascript using <a href=https://unminify.com/>unminify</a> to try and understand it more.</p><p>One of the first things I tried once unminifying it was decoding some of the strings within <code>a</code> (the majorly long array). Many of the strings end in <code>=</code>, which is a common indicator for base64 encoding. However, this proved to be a red herring as a few of the first I tried were simply gibberish and I didn&rsquo;t have the patience to keep going.</p><p>Scrolling through the source code more, I find a variable <code>seq</code> that appears to be an array of arrows, i.e. a sequence of arrow keys to enter.</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wh03-seq.jpg alt="Screenshot of seq variable"></p><p>However, I don&rsquo;t really speak hexadecimal, and looking at the <code>b</code> function is a nightmare in itself. The <code>seq</code> variable is used in this function which prints the <strong>Flag</strong>:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wh03-flag-code.jpg alt="Screenshot of flag function"></p><p>I eventually ended up coming back to this challenge towards the end of the CTF, and realised that although the console functions are disabled, the console itself isn&rsquo;t - and a Javascript console essentially acts similar to a Python interpreter. If you give it a variable, it will print the value for you.</p><p>So, naturally, I just printed the <code>seq</code> constant:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wh03-seq-console.jpg alt="Screenshot of console printing the seq constant; its value is up up up down left right left right"></p><p>However, when I try this, it doesn&rsquo;t work. No worry - there&rsquo;s still the flag function to try. The flag function <code>u</code> builds the flag in variable <code>e</code> using arrays <code>h</code> and <code>r</code>.</p><p>So, I find the value of <code>h[b("0x23", "yOrU")]</code> to see what the ending index is, and then just construct the flag from there:</p><p><img src=/img/wicys-beginner-ctf/wh03-flag-console.jpg alt="Screenshot of console printing the length 9, and the flag"></p><p><strong>Tools</strong>: Chrome Dev Tools, <a href=https://unminify.com/>unminify</a><br><strong>Flag</strong>: rANDom_VICTORy_113</p><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>This was my second CTF ever, and the first where I actually completed all the challenges! Overall I placed 14th out of 449 players, and I&rsquo;m quite happy with that.</p><p>Regretfully I didn&rsquo;t think of doing a write-up <em>while</em> I was doing the CTF, and the CTF platform Tomahawque does not allow players to view challenges once the event has finished. Thus, screenshots/exact wording of the actual challenge descriptions are limited/non-existent.</p><p>Doing this writeup as one long piece after the CTF was also a pain, just because I had to go through the trouble of, basically, redoing all the challenges (with the exception of Caesar) without having access to them! Which made it &mldr; difficult.</p><p>Overall, I think this was really good for a beginner CTF, just because most of the challenges were relatively easy to understand. My favourite challenges were definitely the ones I could instantly use <code>xxd</code> on - like <a href=#be01>BE01</a> and <a href=#f03>F03</a>. Some challenges were quite hard - <a href=#fm02>FM02</a> and <a href=#wh03>WH03</a> in particular - and required a lot more work, but that was good - it gave me a chance to learn more tools! On the whole, it was a positive experience and I&rsquo;m so glad I got a chance to play.</p></div></article><div id=footer-post-container><div id=footer-post><div id=nav-footer style=display:none><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/experience>Experience</a></li><li><a href=/posts>Posts</a></li><li><a href=/writings>Publications</a></li></ul></div><div id=toc-footer style=display:none><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#w01>W01</a></li><li><a href=#a01>A01</a></li><li><a href=#fe01>FE01</a></li><li><a href=#w03>W03</a></li><li><a href=#c01>C01</a></li><li><a href=#ce01>CE01</a></li><li><a href=#fe02>FE02</a></li><li><a href=#l01>L01</a></li><li><a href=#f03>F03</a></li><li><a href=#fm02>FM02</a></li><li><a href=#w02>W02</a></li><li><a href=#we01>WE01</a></li><li><a href=#be01>BE01</a></li><li><a href=#we02>WE02</a></li><li><a href=#wh03>WH03</a></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a></li></ul></nav></div><div id=share-footer style=display:none><ul><li><a class=icon href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f"><i class="fab fa-facebook fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&text=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&title=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&is_video=false&description=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-pinterest fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="mailto:?subject=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF&body=Check out this article: https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f"><i class="fas fa-envelope fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://getpocket.com/save?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&title=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-get-pocket fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&title=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-reddit fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&title=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://digg.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&title=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-digg fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&name=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF&description=Last%20week%20I%20had%20the%20chance%20to%20participate%20in%20the%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF%20as%20part%20of%20a%20qualification%20round%20for%20the%20SANS%20Security%20Training%20Scholarship%20by%20Women%20in%20Cybersecurity%20%28WiCyS%29.%20%5bEdit%3a%20I%20also%20made%20it%20forward%20to%20the%20next%20round%21%5d%20This%20was%20a%20closed%2c%20Jeopardy-style%20CTF%20that%20ran%20for%20four%20days%20%28Aug%207-10%29.%20It%20was%20also%20a%20solo%20CTF%2c%20although%20we%20did%20have%20a%20Slack%20channel%20where%20people%20occasionally%20shared%20hints%20to%20especially%20hard-to-solve%20problems."><i class="fab fa-tumblr fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fwicys-beginner-ctf%2f&t=Writeup%3a%20SANS%20Interactive%20Beginner%20Challenge%20CTF"><i class="fab fa-hacker-news fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li></ul></div><div id=actions-footer><a id=menu class=icon href=# onclick="return $('#nav-footer').toggle(),!1"><i class="fas fa-bars fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i> Menu</a>

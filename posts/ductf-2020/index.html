Though our team didn&rsquo;t come anywhere close to placing, or even completing all the challenges, we had a fun time and learned some new techniques for our next CTF.</p><p>This writeup is a team effort by me, <a href=https://twitter.com/deanjiao>Dean Jiao</a>, and <a href=http://github.com/rujuj>Ruju Jambusaria</a>, and was written while we were solving challenges. It is <em>not</em> an exhaustive writeup (please consult <a href=https://github.com/DownUnderCTF/Challenges_2020_public>the organizers' writeup</a> for a full writeup). Instead, this writeup is a collaborative effort in exploring dead ends, throwing ideas on the wall, and seeing what sticks.</p><p>Challenges we made a decent attempt at completing (or successfully solved) are therefore included below; other challenges are not.</p><h1 id=background>Background</h1><p>Down Under CTF 2020 ran from Friday, September 18 5AM EDT to Sunday, September 20 5AM EDT (7PM Australian Eastern Time). There were <a href=https://twitter.com/DownUnderCTF/status/1307651854134734848>over 3000 participants</a>, and over 1000 teams on the scoreboard.</p><p>Our team was called &ldquo;why not make team&rdquo; (&mldr; this is a long story), and consisted of me, Dean, and Ruju. If you&rsquo;re curious about how we did overall, you can checkout <a href=#conclusion>our team stats</a> near the end.</p><p>There were seven challenge categories, with difficulties ranging from &ldquo;sanity check&rdquo; to &ldquo;insane&rdquo;.</p><ol><li><a href=#osint>OSInt</a></li><li><a href=#forensics>Forensics</a></li><li><a href=#web>Web</a></li><li><a href=#crypto>Crypto</a></li><li><a href=#misc>Misc</a></li><li><a href=#pwn>Pwn</a></li><li><a href=#reversing>Reversing</a></li></ol><h1 id=osint>OSInt</h1><h2 id=petstagram>Petstagram</h2><p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Beginner<br><em>Who is Alexandros the cat exactly? And who is this mysterious &ldquo;mum&rdquo; he keeps talking about?<br>Submit his mum&rsquo;s full name in lowercase and with underscores instead of spaces, as the flag: DUCTF{name}</em></p><p>Given the challenge name, searching on Instagram for Alexandros the cat seemed like a good start. It brought us to <a href=https://www.instagram.com/alexandrosthecat/>this profile</a>:
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/petstagram-alexandros.png alt="Screenshot of Instagram profile for alexandrosthecat. There are two posts, a black and white photo of a cat and a coloured photo of (presumably) the same cat with a red bow. The account has 9 followers and is following no one."></p><p>Dipping into the followers, we then found <a href=https://www.instagram.com/emwaters92/>this person, Emily Waters</a>:
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/petstagram-emwaters92.png alt="Screenshot of Instagram profile for emwaters92. There are two posts, a video where the current frame is black and the same black and white cat photo from Alexandros. The accounts has 9 followers and is only following 1 account."></p><p>Whom we suspected to be the &ldquo;mum&rdquo; referenced. However, entering <code>DUCTF{emily_waters}</code> didn&rsquo;t work, and we realised there was a middle name from the email:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh>emilytwaters92@gmail.com
</code></pre></div><p>Sending an email to that email address got us an out-of-office reply:
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/petstagram-og.jpg alt="Email to emilytwaters@gmail.com. Subject line: &ldquo;Business inquiry: middle name&rdquo;. Body: &ldquo;Hi there! I love your cat Alexandros!

<img src=/img/ductf-2020/petstagram-reply.png alt="Email reply from emilytwaters@gmail.com. Subject line: &ldquo;Out of Office from September 6th Re: Business inquiry: middle name&rdquo;. Body: &ldquo;Hello, I will be out of the office from Sunday, September 6th onward. If you need immediate assistance during my absence, that sounds like a you problem. Otherwise, I will probably respond to your emails as soon as possible if I return. Kind regards, Emily Theresa Waters." "></p><p>Which gave us the flag in the signature.</p><p><strong>Flag</strong>: DUCTF{emily_theresa_waters}</p><h2 id=bad-man>Bad Man</h2><p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Easy<br><em>We have recently received reports about a hacker who goes by the alias und3rm4t3r. He has been threatening innocent people for money and must be stopped. Help us find him and get us the flag.</em></p><p>Googling <code>und3m4t3r</code> or searching for the <code>und3rm4t3r</code> user on Discord revealed nothing.</p><p><em>Post-CTF</em>: Turns out we were supposed to look for <a href=https://twitter.com/und3rm4t3r>them on <em>Twitter</em></a> instead.</p><p>One of their Tweets mentioned &ldquo;deleting a Tweet that contained personal information&rdquo;, which had been conveniently snapshotted <a href=http://web.archive.org/web/20200723112257/https://twitter.com/und3rm4t3r>on the Wayback Machine</a>:

If only I knew its registration number&mldr; I bet I&rsquo;d be able to find out all kinds of information, like the day it first flew!<br>The flag will be the date of the first flight of the plane I saw in this format: DUCTF{DD-MM-YY}</em></p><p><em>Fun fact</em>: we were the 10th team to solve this one!</p><p>We started with Googling the &ldquo;boxing croc&rdquo;, since we all had no idea what it was:
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/take-off-boxing-croc.png alt="Screenshot of Google info card on the &ldquo;boxing croc&rdquo;, or rather, the &ldquo;Big Boxing Crocodile&rdquo;. There is a photo of a crocodile statue wearing boxing gloves, as well as a screenshot of Google Maps showing the boxing croc&rsquo;s location. It is a tourist attraction in Humpty Doo, Australia, and its address is 326 Arnhem Hwy, Humpty Doo NT 0836, Australia."></p><p>Looking at a map, we noticed that Darwin International Airport was nearby, so it was likely that any aircraft going over the Boxing Croc was probably heading into or out of Darwin.
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/take-off-darwin-map.png alt="Screenshot of Google Maps showing Darwin and the boxing croc"></p><p>Next, we looked at a list of American refueling planes, hoping to find a model so we could find flight data for them. This was inconclusive, especially since flight trackers only showed flights from the past 7 days.</p><p>We also found <a href=http://www.planeflighttracker.com/2014/04/united-states-military-aircraft-in.html>this totally not sketchy site</a> for finding the model codes for military aircraft.
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/take-off-aircraft-tracker.png alt="Screenshot of United States NATO Military Aircraft Tracker and which aircraft are in operation."></p><p>However, a whole bunch of googling later, we still found nothing.</p><p>We happened upon an article about an <a href=https://www.pacom.mil/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/2336270/increasing-interoperability-b-2s-b-1s-join-us-marine-corps-australian-defence-f/>Australian/American Joint Air Force exercise</a> that happened near the given date, and it mentioned a particular refueling plane, the Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker. with model number K35R.</p><p>Still, flight trackers had no historical data going that far back, so we had to get a 7-day free trial for <a href=https://www.radarbox.com/>RadarBox</a>. Searching for all flights with the model K35R, we looked for flights around September 1st.
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/take-off-flight-list.png alt="Screenshot of flight list around September 1st"></p><p>We eventually found a flight whose path looked like it went over where Boxing Croc would be:
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/take-off-darwin-flight.png alt="Screenshot of flight PEARL02 which curves over to Darwin"></p><p>Googling the plane registration number: <code>58-0086</code> then led to
<a href=https://planefinder.net/data/aircraft/58-0086>https://planefinder.net/data/aircraft/58-0086</a>, revealing the final flag.</p><p><strong>Flag</strong>: DUCTF{16-07-59}<br><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href=https://maps.google.com>Google Maps</a>, <a href=https://www.planeflighttracker.com>Plane Flight Tracker</a>, <a href=https://www.radarbox.com/>RadarBox</a>, <a href=https://planefinder.net/>Plane Finder</a></p><h2 id=a-turn-of-events-w-some-really-bad-opsec>A turn of events w/ some REALLY bad OPSEC</h2><p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Hard<br><em>We have identified the key suspect in multiple crimes, with authorities in pursuit.

We also knew that her location tag in this video was the Gelateria on the Docks, near Melbourne&rsquo;s ports.</p><p>Using a <a href=http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/>DTMF tone converter</a>, followed by a <a href=https://www.dcode.fr/t9-cipher>T9 Decoder</a>, we were able to get the message:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-sh data-lang=sh><span style=color:#bd93f9>6338063028090300</span>
MEET ME AT 9:30
</code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately at this point we stopped, thinking we didn&rsquo;t have much of a lead. We noticed that the gelato place was not open at 9:30, and there were tramboat cruises available nearby, but we had no idea what a &ldquo;call sign&rdquo; was.</p><p><em>Post-CTF</em>: However, had we gone a little further and noticed the Port of Melbourne nearby, we could have obtained a list of ships that were passing through on or after 9:30AM. This would&rsquo;ve eventually led us to find the call sign of the ship that Emily boarded.</p><p>We also could&rsquo;ve used the MAC address on <a href=https://wigle.net>Wigle</a>, which could have confirmed Emily&rsquo;s location and perhaps pointed us to the Port of Melbourne more closely.</p><p><strong>Flag</strong>: DUCTF{SWHR_CAP_VICTOR}<br><strong>Tools</strong>: <a href=http://dialabc.com/sound/detect/>DTMF tone converter</a>, <a href=https://www.dcode.fr/t9-cipher>T9 Decoder</a>, <a href=https://wigle.net>Wigle</a></p><h2 id=off-the-rails>Off the Rails</h2><p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Hard<br><em>I&rsquo;m in trouble, I&rsquo;m on the run&mldr; My friend told me he would meet me underneath a rail bridge 2km from his house before we escape on a train but he forgot to tell me where he lived.<br>He took two day trips relatively close by and sent me two photos. I also know that late last year, there was a fire near the suburbs approximately 25km from where he lives.<br>He lives somewhere in the middle of those three points. Could you tell me the name of the road parallel to the bridge, and the latitude and longitude of the bridge?<br>P.S. The longitude and latitude should be to 3 decimal places (plus if necessary include the . and/or -). Each segement of the flag should be seperated by an underscore. The road name type should be the same as when you find it. The flag is also case insensitive.<br>Example: DUCTF{latitude_longitude_nameofroad_roadnametype}</em></p><p>Using the bridge image provided, we were able to find out the type of bridge on Google with a reverse image search.
<img src=/img/ductf-2020/otr-trestle.png alt="Screenshot of Google reverse image search, showing &ldquo;trestle&rdquo; as the recommended search term"></p><p>With this in mind, and knowing the fire tidbit, we began to search for bridges that had had fires nearby. The list we came up with was:</p><ul><li>Noojee</li><li>Monbulk</li><li>Wairewa</li><li>Stony Creek</li></ul><p>However, none of the coordinates/road names that we found parallel to the bridges were the correct flag, so we stopped there.</p><p><em>Post-CTF</em>: What we forgot to use was the picture of the koala, which apparently had EXIF data to be extracted using <code>exiftool</code>. This would have helped create the triangle necessary to find the correct bridge and coordinate spot.</p><p>As it turns out, one of the bridges we had researched (Monbulk) <em>was</em> actually the correct bridge, but not having the other pieces, we were unable to successfully triangulate the correct train line necessary.</p><h1 id=forensics>Forensics</h1><h2 id=on-the-spectrum>On the spectrum</h2><p><strong>Difficulty</strong>: Beginner<br><em>My friend has been sending me lots of WAV files, I think he is trying to communicate with me, what is the message he sent?</em></p><p>The WAV file that&rsquo;s given sounds like white noise with some patterns:

We wanted to look further into the &ldquo;response code&rdquo;, but we ran into some installation issues with <a href=https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb><code>adb</code></a>, so we were unable to actually dig into what kind of requests the app was making.</p><p><em>Post-CTF</em>: Looking at the official write-up for this situation, I&rsquo;m not actually sure we would&rsquo;ve gotten there even if we <em>had</em> <code>adb</code> properly installed. They used <a href=https://ibotpeaches.github.io/Apktool/><code>apktool</code></a> to decode and rebuild the APK ater patching it - we didn&rsquo;t even know this existed.

(Many of the challenges featured dynamic scoring, meaning that the number of points went down as more people solved them.)

As three people who grew up in Canada and have never traveled to Australia, it was fun seeing and learning so much about Australia (we learned what the boxing croc is! or who Clive Palmer is!).</p><p>Looking forward to Down Under CTF 2021 - maybe next year we&rsquo;ll be better ðŸ˜Š</p></div></article><div id=footer-post-container><div id=footer-post><div id=nav-footer

instead of Github Pages</li><li>I&rsquo;m taking advantage of Netlify&rsquo;s Deploy Previews</li></ol><p>All of these changes came with <em>some</em> level of consideration, so I want to take some time to walk through my thought process here. (Just in case anyone else is thinking about it!)</p><p>In this first post, I&rsquo;ll be tackling my troubles with custom domains and hosting.<br>In the <a href=/posts/deploy-custom>next post</a>, I&rsquo;ll be talking about why I moved to Netlify and using Deploy Previews.</p><h1 id=getting-a-custom-domain>Getting a Custom Domain</h1><p>A few weeks ago, among the flurry of excitement that was <a href=/posts/ductf-2020>Down Under CTF</a>, I bought the domain <code>joyce.fyi</code> on a whim.</p><p>I say &ldquo;on a whim&rdquo;, but buying a domain was a huge step for me! I&rsquo;ve been using Github Pages since 2017, and I&rsquo;ve always, always just used the <code>thejoycekung.github.io</code> URL.</p><p>There are a lot of problems with it<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>, but it&rsquo;s <em>free</em>. And I&rsquo;d never bought a domain before (even for a project), so the thought of venturing out into the domain-name buying world was a little off-putting. So I just kept using the default one.</p><p>When I restarted blogging this year, I realised that linking to posts was creating some really long URLs. And this wasn&rsquo;t going to go away: I was stuck with long URLs as long as I was still using Github&rsquo;s free domain.</p><p>So I started looking for domains. I wanted to scope out domains that were related to my name somehow (<code>joy.ce</code> or <code>joyceku.ng</code>, anyone?) but when that didn&rsquo;t pan out, I started looking at the list of possible TLDs and considering which ones I would actually want to use.<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> Amazingly, I found <code>joyce.fyi</code>, for sale on Google Domains for $27/year.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup> And after spying on it for a week (hoping desperately no one would snatch it from me), I finally caved in and bought it.</p><p>Afterwards, all I had to do was set my brand-new domain up with Github Pages. Easy, right? <em><em>Right?!?</em></em></p><h1 id=easy-domain-setup-with-github-pages>Easy Domain Setup with Github Pages</h1><p>Man, I wish.</p><p>To start, I tried using <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site>Github&rsquo;s own documentation</a> for setting up a custom domain (in my case, an apex domain<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>).</p><p>&mldr; And got to about step 3 before I got stuck.<sup id=fnref:5><a href=#fn:5 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>5</a></sup> For some unknown reason (to me, at least), Github was giving me an error everytime I tried to save my <code>CNAME</code> - it kept giving me the error <code>CNAME already taken</code>.</p><p>As someone who has never bought a domain, this was a little horrifying to read. What do you mean my freshly minted domain name is already taken? Who took it? What is going on? How do I get it back?</p><p>It really didn&rsquo;t help that Github had this disclaimer on their docs:</p><blockquote><p>Configuring your custom domain with your DNS provider without adding your custom domain to GitHub could result in someone else being able to host a site on one of your subdomains.</p></blockquote><p>Which doesn&rsquo;t sound ominous at all!</p><p>I knew this situation didn&rsquo;t apply to me, though. I hadn&rsquo;t configured <em>anything</em> through Google yet, so this weird error was all on Github.</p><p>So, instead of trying to use the Github UI to add a <code>CNAME</code>, I did it through Git itself. I just created a file called <code>CNAME</code> and pushed it, with my domain <code>joyce.fyi</code> inside. Github didn&rsquo;t complain then! So I kept forging ahead.</p><p>I went back to Google and continued following Github&rsquo;s instructions for apex domains, adding an <code>A</code> record to their servers, and a <code>CNAME</code> record to point to <code>thejoycekung.github.io</code> with the <code>www</code> name. I even patiently waited for DNS to propagate and checked with <code>dig</code> that my domain was now pointing to the Github load-balancers.</p><p>Easy, right? Everything should work, right?</p><blockquote><p>no ❤</p></blockquote><p>Instead of showing <em>my</em> beautifully styled Hugo site, navigating to <code>joyce.fyi</code> instead showed, well, I guess, someone <em>else&rsquo;s</em> site. Someone else who also had the name Joyce, who wanted to say &ldquo;Hello World. I am Joyce.&rdquo;</p><p>Someone who wasn&rsquo;t me. 👀</p><h1 id=a-quick-tour-of-dns>A Quick Tour of DNS</h1><p>I&rsquo;ll start off by saying I don&rsquo;t really understand DNS. All I know is that it is the routing system for most of the internet as I know it, as it is the translator for IP addresses to/from domains<sup id=fnref:6><a href=#fn:6 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>6</a></sup>, and when things go wrong with the internet, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s always DNS&rdquo; will probably be said at some point (because it&rsquo;s probably DNS).</p><p>To understand my newfound case of <del>identity fraud</del> DNS troubles, I tried to break down what on earth was going on with my domain name and Github.</p><p>The <code>CNAME</code> record that I added to Google pointed to my Github Pages URL, <code>thejoycekung.github.io</code>. Its purpose was to say, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re looking for <code>www.joyce.fyi</code>, where you should <em>really</em> go is actually <code>thejoycekung.github.io</code>&rdquo;.</p><p>The <code>CNAME</code> record in my repo, <code>thejoycekung.github.io</code>, then pointed <em>back</em> to <code>joyce.fyi</code>. Unsure why this was needed?</p><p>The <code>A</code> record was the important DNS record, from what I knew. By adding in the IP addresses for Github&rsquo;s servers, I was essentially telling everyone on the internet, &ldquo;Hey! If you want to go to <code>joyce.fyi</code>, you should go ask Github!&rdquo;</p><p>To summarize, this is what I thought the path was:<br><code>CNAME</code> (Google) ➡ <code>CNAME</code> (Github) ➡ <code>A</code> (Google) ➡ Github serves my page.</p><p>But something had clearly gone wrong in the last step.</p><p>So my first thought wasn&rsquo;t that someone had stolen my domain; my first thought was actually that someone had previously owned the domain <code>joyce.fyi</code> and had <em>also</em> used Github Pages to configure it.</p><p>My guess is that Github probably used those <code>CNAME</code>s to determine which repo to serve when their nameserver was given a domain name query. And since it had errored out trying to accept <em>my</em> <code>CNAME</code><sup id=fnref:7><a href=#fn:7 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>7</a></sup>, it meant that their name server didn&rsquo;t know that they were supposed to serve my repo when given the query <code>joyce.fyi</code>.</p><h1 id=now-what>Now What?</h1><p>I did a lot of Googling about this. It turns out that someone owning your domain before you and also having it hosted on Github Pages is not exactly a common problem. (Sigh.)</p><p>I sent an email off to Github Support, fingers crossed, asking if they had any guidance on what to do. How was I even going to find this person and tell them pretty please, stop hogging my domain because it&rsquo;s mine now?</p><p>The correct answer was, I was not. So I needed to find another way to host my website.</p><h1 id=easy-domain-setup-with-github-pages-netlify>Easy Domain Setup with <del>Github Pages</del> Netlify</h1><p>I&rsquo;d heard of Netlify for a while now (and by a while I mean this summer). It seemed like a great way to get a site up and running really fast - especially a static site - just by hooking up a Git repo to my account.</p><p>And &mldr; it was, actually. It even had a spot for a build command, like <code>hugo</code>, and a spot to configure which directory and branch to build from. However, since I had a perfectly fine Github Action that built my Hugo site to my <code>gh-pages</code> branch already, I simply pointed Netlify to my <code>gh-pages</code> branch, told it not to run any commands, and use the repo directory <code>.</code> as the source code.</p><p>And it worked.</p><p>And then all I had to do was configure my Google DNS records to point to Netlify&rsquo;s load balancer and my new Netlify URL, and add <code>joyce.fyi</code> in the domain settings on Netlify.</p><p>And that &mldr; also worked. After encountering so much friction with Github Pages, having something <em>just work</em> felt like magic again.</p><p>But obviously that wasn&rsquo;t the end of it.</p><h1 id=easy-domain-setup-with-github-pages-netlify-github-pages>Easy Domain Setup with <del>Github Pages</del> <del>Netlify</del> Github Pages</h1><p>I know, I know. I had a working setup. Why go back to Github Pages? Just burn the whole thing and move to Netlify.<sup id=fnref:8><a href=#fn:8 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>8</a></sup></p><p>Github Support actually responded to me around 12 hours after I filed my ticket, saying:</p><blockquote><p>The error you&rsquo;re seeing generally occurs when a custom domain has previously been owned by another GitHub user, or the domain has been added to a GitHub repository in error. If we can verify that you own the domain, we can free it up for your use using our admin tools.</p></blockquote><p>A little odd that they can just <code>free it up</code> like that. With their <code>admin tools</code>.</p><p>But no matter. I was a woman on a mission to have <code>thejoycekung.github.io</code> redirect to <code>joyce.fyi</code>,<sup id=fnref:9><a href=#fn:9 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>9</a></sup> and my Netlify site was just a temporary diversion. I switched my <code>A</code> and <code>CNAME</code> records to point to Github again.</p><p>Github Support gave me instructions on adding a <code>TXT</code> record, and they asked me to include a verification code as the value, so that I could prove I owned the domain.</p><p><img src=/img/github-verify.png alt="Screenshot of Google Domains: An A record has 4 Github IP addresses; below, a TXT record that has a Github verification code; finally, a CNAME that points my site to thejoycekung.github.io."></p><p>After verifying that my <code>TXT</code> record had properly propagated using <code>dig</code>, I sent an email back to them saying so, to which they replied that they &ldquo;released&rdquo; the <code>CNAME</code> for me to claim.<sup id=fnref:10><a href=#fn:10 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>10</a></sup></p><p>And with that &mldr; entering the <code>CNAME</code> on the Github UI finally didn&rsquo;t error out.</p><p>And finally, after at least 15 hours of &ldquo;what on earth is going on&rdquo;, my site was being properly hosted from Github Pages using my new domain <code>joyce.fyi</code>.</p><p>Of course, I had to go and change that again in the coming weeks. But <a href=/posts/deploy-custom>that&rsquo;s in Part 2</a>.</p><section class=footnotes role=doc-endnotes><hr><ol><li id=fn:1 role=doc-endnote><p>Mostly it&rsquo;s super long.

Isn&rsquo;t it at least a <em>little</em> disconcerting that Github Support can just reach in and &ldquo;release&rdquo; a repo&rsquo;s <code>CNAME</code>? Considering how it&rsquo;s stored per repo as a file, it seems like Github can just &mldr; reach in and delete any file from your repo. And even ignoring their power for a second, are there any ways for bad actors to potentially &mldr; add DNS records without an owner&rsquo;s knowledge? (Is that DNS cache poisoning? I don&rsquo;t understand how DNS works.

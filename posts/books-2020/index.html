However, recently the show&rsquo;s director, Michelle Latimer, has been shown to have <a href=https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/michelle-latimer-kitigan-zibi-indigenous-identity-1.5845310>questionable (if not non-existent) ties</a> to her claimed Indigenous communities. <a href=https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/michelle-latimer-resigns-trickster-1.5850408>Latimer will no longer be working on the show in Season 2</a>.&#160;<a href=#fnref:8 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:9 role=doc-endnote><p>This is the book that sat on our living room table from March to June. My sister, ever a minimalist, <em>hated</em> the fact that it would stay in our living room with no foreseeable return date. I remember trying to return it - thinking maybe - and discovering that the return slots at the library were taped shut. Since borrowing this book, I have only stepped into a library once this year, to borrow a physical book whose hold line was much, much shorter than the ebook hold line.&#160;<a href=#fnref:9 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:10 role=doc-endnote><p>There are several creative depictions of blowjobs in this book.

I wish I&rsquo;d known that would be my last time going to Waterloo for the foreseeable future.

I wish I could&rsquo;ve seen this coworker more.). I don&rsquo;t remember reading that in the book, but I remember finding the book real interesting.&#160;<a href=#fnref:16 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li><li id=fn:17 role=doc-endnote><p>This is my small confession space. If you read carefully, I started reading <em>Do Not Say We Have Nothing</em> on December 31, 2019, AKA I did not fully read this book in 2020, AKA I probably cheated. There are several things that went wrong (that I did wrong?) that culminated in me having to read 2 books in one week (as opposed to one) (<em>The New Queer Conscience</em> and <em>Everything Is Beautiful, and I&rsquo;m Not Afraid</em>) and me needing to finish <em>Bestiary</em> in the span of three days: namely, I did not start reading things until January 6th, the first Monday of the year, and I counted my weeks starting Monday - Sunday. (There is of course, no &ldquo;have to&rdquo; or &ldquo;need&rdquo; to do any of this. I could have just easily said, &ldquo;haha, fuck it.") I do not actually know if I hit the &ldquo;actual&rdquo; goal of reading a book a week in 2020. There are 52 weeks in a year apparently. 2020 felt like many more.&#160;<a href=#fnref:17 class=footnote-backref role=doc-backlink>&#8617;&#xfe0e;</a></p></li></ol></section></div></article><div id=footer-post-container><div id=footer-post><div id=nav-footer style=display:none><ul><li><a href=/>Home</a></li><li><a href=/experience>Experience</a></li><li><a href=/posts>Posts</a></li><li><a href=/writings>Publications</a></li></ul></div><div id=toc-footer style=display:none><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#criteria-and-selection>Criteria and Selection</a></li><li><a href=#the-worst-ones>The Worst Ones</a></li><li><a href=#most-wtf-did-i-just-read>Most &ldquo;WTF did I just read&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=#i-mean-it-was-like-ok-i-guess>&ldquo;I mean it was, like, Ok I guess&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=#this-got-a-little-too-topical>&ldquo;This got a little too topical&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=#my-favourite-books-of-2020>My Favourite Books of 2020</a></li><li><a href=#every-book-i-read-in-2020-in-chronological-orderahem>Every Book I Read in 2020, in Chronological Order</a></li><li><a href=#to-2021>To 2021</a></li></ul></nav></div><div id=share-footer style=display:none><ul><li><a class=icon href="http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f"><i class="fab fa-facebook fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&text=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-twitter fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&title=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-linkedin fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/bookmarklet/?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&is_video=false&description=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-pinterest fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="mailto:?subject=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks&body=Check out this article: https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f"><i class="fas fa-envelope fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://getpocket.com/save?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&title=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-get-pocket fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&title=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-reddit fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&title=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://digg.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&title=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-digg fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="http://www.tumblr.com/share/link?url=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&name=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks&description=TL%3bDR%3a%20I%20read%20a%20lot%20of%20books%20this%20year.%20I%20put%20some%20on%20lists.%20I%20will%20not%20justify%20these%20lists.1%0aAt%20the%20end%20of%202019%2c%20I%20vaguely%20thought%20about%20reading%20one%20book%20a%20week%20in%202020.%20It%20was%20going%20to%20be%20one%20of%20my%20%26ldquo%3bNew%20Year%26rsquo%3bs%20Resolutions%26rdquo%3b%2c2%20and%20I%20really%20felt%20like%20I%20missed%20reading%20for%20fun%20again.3%0aThat%20term%20-%20fall%202019%20-%20I%20had%20taken%20one%20of%20my%20favourite%20classes%20ever%20in%20university%20-%20ENGL%20208N%3a%20Sex%20in%20Literature%2c%20and%20after%20reading%20a%20bunch%20of%20raunchy%20shit%20for%20class%20-%20after%20finding%20reading%20fun%20again%21"><i class="fab fa-tumblr fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li><li><a class=icon href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitlink?u=https%3a%2f%2fjoyce.fyi%2fposts%2fbooks-2020%2f&t=2020%3a%20Reading%20~52%20Books%20in%20~52%20Weeks"><i class="fab fa-hacker-news fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i></a></li></ul></div><div id=actions-footer><a id=menu class=icon href=# onclick="return $('#nav-footer').toggle(),!1"><i class="fas fa-bars fa-lg" aria-hidden=true></i> Menu</a>

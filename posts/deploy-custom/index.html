So the &ldquo;current&rdquo; workflow isn&rsquo;t really true. And I don&rsquo;t want to make them install something they don&rsquo;t use, for the simple task of editing my work.</p><p>How could we make this simpler?</p><h1 id=exploring-my-options>Exploring my Options</h1><p>The pain point for me in this workflow was getting others to install Hugo (building the site once having installed Hugo is easy, that&rsquo;s not the problem).</p><p>One way to avoid the problem altogether was just push my work to a branch and let them review a plain Markdown file. Although Markdown is readable, I figured it would be better to allow them to read the formatted version instead - that way they can also catch any (accidental) formatting flukes I&rsquo;ve made.</p><p>Once I nailed down the fact that I wanted the site to actually be built, I needed to think about <em>where</em>. I thought about using a self-hosted Docker container that used a Hugo image (that way Hugo wouldn&rsquo;t have to be redownloaded everytime). The container could have a public IP and exposed port, and a user could then try to view that resulting post by navigating to the combination <code>IP:port</code>.</p><p>I wanted to try it out a little as an exercise to me (in writing Dockerfiles), but then I realised that this is actually &mldr; probably a pretty common problem. And someone had likely created a solution for it already.</p><h1 id=choosing-netlify-for-quick-deployments>Choosing Netlify for Quick Deployments</h1><p>After some (a lot?) of searching to see what <em>other</em> people had chosen to do for their PR deployments, I found my way back to Netlify again.</p><p>I discovered that Netlify had this cool feature called <a href=https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/07/20/introducing-deploy-previews-in-netlify/>Deploy Previews</a>, and remembering how painless it was to set up Netlify originally, I decided to try and use Deploy Previews as a simple way to deploy my PRs.</p><p>The one thing that I couldn&rsquo;t <em>quite</em> understand was how to actually &mldr; trigger them?</p><h1 id=creating-a-netlify-actions-workflow>Creating a Netlify Actions Workflow</h1><p>Because it&rsquo;s Github, and <a href=https://twitter.com/commitsbyjoyce/status/1282792509882748928>I&rsquo;ve tried out Github Actions</a> before, I decided to look on the Actions Marketplace to find an action that could help me out.</p><p>I found <a href=https://github.com/marketplace/actions/netlify-actions>Netlify Actions by nwtgck</a> which seemed to meet my needs perfectly; the description reads:</p><blockquote><p>Github Actions for deploying to Netlify</p></blockquote><p>Truly music to my ears.</p><p>With that Action in mind, I started thinking about what I needed to make this work.</p><ul><li><input disabled type=checkbox> I needed to have my Netlify site again, but I wasn&rsquo;t actually going to use it for anything - I just needed auth and a site ID so I could run this Action.</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> I also needed a built version of the site in a directory, so the Action could actually get code to deploy (after all, there&rsquo;s no separate branch here).</li><li><input disabled type=checkbox> Finally, I needed an actual workflow in YAML so that it would actually run on a branch I set up.</li></ul><p>So this is the workflow that I actually came up with:</p><ol><li><a href=https://github.com/marketplace/actions/checkout><code>actions/checkout@v2</code></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hugo-setup><code>peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2</code></a></li><li><code>hugo</code> (shell step - not an Action)</li><li><a href=https://github.com/marketplace/actions/netlify-actions><code>nwtgck/actions-netlify@v1.1</code></a></li></ol><p>Essentially, first, we&rsquo;ll checkout the repo using <code>actions/checkout@v2</code>. Then, we&rsquo;ll install Hugo using <code>peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2</code>. Then, we&rsquo;ll run <code>hugo</code> as a shell step and build the site. Finally, we&rsquo;ll deploy the <code>public</code> directory to Netlify using <code>nwtgck/actions-netlify@v1.1</code>.</p><p>In order to test this all out, I put that all into a YAML file on <code>master</code>, made a branch (with a draft of this current post, actually!) and pushed it, creating a pull request and therefore triggering the workflow.</p><p>And &mldr; then it failed.</p><h1 id=creating-scrapping-my-netlify-actions-workflow><del>Creating</del> Scrapping my Netlify Actions Workflow</h1><p>Well, actually, it failed in a couple ways.</p><p>First off, I didn&rsquo;t realise that using Netlify Actions wouldn&rsquo;t somehow auto-magically get the right base URL. My base URL <code>joyce.fyi</code> is configured in my <code>config.toml</code> file, so when pulling assets (like, uh, say, CSS), they would pull from <code>joyce.fyi/{css_file_name}</code>. But this didn&rsquo;t just apply to assets: it also applied to links on the page. So when I tried to open my new post from this Netlify deploy, I actually went to <code>joyce.fyi/posts/{new_post_name}</code> - which, obviously, didn&rsquo;t exist yet.</p><p>The second thing that I didn&rsquo;t realise was that Netlify itself was <em>also</em> trying to deploy this branch (using those magical Deploy Previews I&rsquo;d read about!) and it was failing, miserably. I didn&rsquo;t realise it while setting up in my haste, but <a href=https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/repo-permissions-linking/#authentication-with-the-netlify-github-app>because I granted Netlify repo access</a>, it had gone ahead and added <a href=https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/reference/checks>Checks</a> to my PRs (one of which was the Deploy Preview).</p><p>My suspicion was that Netlify was failing because I had configured it to build (the production version of) my site by essentially, not doing anything and pulling the source code from the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. So it was getting <em>real</em> confused on what the heck was happening.</p><p>To fix the Netlify workflow I had created, I probably needed to reconfigure how the <code>baseUrl</code> from my site is loaded. After some searching, I discovered that this was configurable from the Hugo command by passing the <code>-b</code> option with a URL. However, how was I supposed to know <em>what</em> URL was going to be generated for this deploy?</p><p>To fix the Netlify checks, I could add some extra configurations to how pull requests are built (through a <code>netlify.toml</code> file). Or I could just disable the checks altogether - but that would remove the deploy previews.</p><p>Or I could abandon Netlify altogether. And go back to my Docker idea, or find other ways to deploy drafts.</p><h1 id=creating-scrapping-fixing-my-netlify-actions-workflow><del>Creating</del> <del>Scrapping</del> Fixing my Netlify <del>Actions</del> Workflow</h1><p>In the end, I decided to add extra configurations to how pull requests are built. I created a <code>netlify.toml</code> file to the root of my repo and added a few lines to configure my pull requests:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml>[build]
HUGO_VERSION = <span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;0.74.3&#34;</span>
<span style=color:#6272a4># Netlify&#39;s Hugo version is lower, causing trouble with taxonomyTerms</span>

[context.deploy-preview]
command = <span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;hugo -b $DEPLOY_PRIME_URL&#34;</span>
publish = <span style=color:#f1fa8c>&#34;public/&#34;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This way, I didn&rsquo;t need a separate Action to install & run Hugo to build my site. In fact, I could get rid of that workflow completely and just <em>trust</em> Netlify to work.</p><p>And since I was relying on Netlify for my pull requests, I figured I might as well use Netlify for the hosting of my actual site as well. Remembering how easy it was to hook it up the first time I did it, I went back and moved my setup (<em>again</em>, I know) to Netlify once more. I even configured a <code>netlify.toml</code> file for the root of my published site<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> to redirect from <code>joycekung.netlify.app</code> to my new domain:</p><div class=highlight><pre style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#282a36;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-toml data-lang=toml>[[redirects]]

</code></pre></div><h1 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h1><p>Now, whenever I want to make a new post (and have it vetted), it can go through this process:</p><ol><li>I write the post and commit my changes to a branch</li><li>I push my branch to Github and create a pull request
This triggers a series of Netlify checks, one of which creates a Deploy Preview of my site.</li><li>My friends read my work in all its fully-formatted glory</li><li>My friends commit their necessary edits to the branch and push their changes, OR they &ldquo;start a review&rdquo; on my PR with their comments/edits</li></ol><p>So I&rsquo;m happy to say that after a few weeks of waffling, I finally have all three things I was looking for:</p><ul><li>A custom domain</li><li>Easy deployments</li><li>Easy deployments for my pull requests</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;ll probably keep modifying the setup for this blog over time.

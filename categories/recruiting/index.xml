Happy to say that I accepted a position as a Site Reliability Engineer in Toronto working remotely for a company. May share more details about this as my start date looms closer (as it stands, we&amp;rsquo;re about 7 months out), but haven&amp;rsquo;t decided yet. Going to leave this post up for posterity&amp;rsquo;s sake. Thanks to anyone who sent me an email about this over the last couple months!</description></item></channel></rss>

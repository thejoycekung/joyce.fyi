It was a busy weekend for why not make team, so I was the only one able to participate (and even then, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have too much time).
As with Down Under CTF, I didn&amp;rsquo;t end up finishing all the challenges (not even close!) so this will serve as a record of what I&amp;rsquo;ve tried (and what didn&amp;rsquo;t work).</description></item><item><title>Writeup: Down Under CTF 2020</title><link>https://joyce.fyi/posts/ductf-2020/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Sep 2020 09:28:04 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://joyce.fyi/posts/ductf-2020/</guid><description>This past weekend, my friends and I had the chance to participate in Down Under CTF 2020, a CTF aimed at Australian secondary- and tertiary-school students. Though our team didn&amp;rsquo;t come anywhere close to placing, or even completing all the challenges, we had a fun time and learned some new techniques for our next CTF.
This writeup is a team effort by me, Dean Jiao, and Ruju Jambusaria, and was written while we were solving challenges.</description></item><item><title>Writeup: SANS Interactive Beginner Challenge CTF</title><link>https://joyce.fyi/posts/wicys-beginner-ctf/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 10:22:11 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://joyce.fyi/posts/wicys-beginner-ctf/</guid><description>Last week I had the chance to participate in the SANS Interactive Beginner Challenge CTF as part of a qualification round for the SANS Security Training Scholarship by Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS). [Edit: I also made it forward to the next round!] This was a closed, Jeopardy-style CTF that ran for four days (Aug 7-10). It was also a solo CTF, although we did have a Slack channel where people occasionally shared hints to especially hard-to-solve problems.</description></item></channel></rss>

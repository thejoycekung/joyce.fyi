When I first learned the chmod command in school, we learned to explicity declare the permissions:
$ chmod a+x file.txt However, whenever running through tutorials or, really, anything that involved chmod, I found that most people like to use the numeric (octal) format instead1:
$ chmod 777 file.txt I knew there was some kind of math involved with chmod, so I decided it would be fun to try writing a chmod calculator in Go, a language I started learning this summer.</description></item></channel></rss>
